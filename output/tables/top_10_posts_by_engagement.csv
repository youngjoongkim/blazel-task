Sri Kosuri,"UPDATE 2/21: I didn't really expect this to get as much reach as it did, but I am thankful for the all the outreach, support, and well wishes. We learned a lot in the last week (and really over the last 48 hours) and the diagnosis has changed now (still rare). It's actually a myeloid sarcoma likely derived from early AML, and the genetics are hopefully pointing to the possibility of new targeted therapies as well (KMT2A translocation). We have a long road ahead of us, but the last week has made it much more clear on the diagnosis and what to do next. Thanks again for all the help. I feel like we have turned over every rock, we are getting great care and in touch with all the relevant folks.

It’s been a tough few weeks. My 10yo daughter was diagnosed with a very rare, aggressive cancer called interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma (IDCS). I’m reaching out to identify clinicians/patients who have encountered pediatric IDCS, indeterminate dendritic cell histiocytosis or other (non-LCH) histiocytic sarcomas cases.

I'm trying to understand non-surgical chemo and targeted therapy options, new pathology markers to better diagnose subtypes/treatments, and any data on progression in pediatric patients. Please feel free to share – I’m trying to cast a wide net due to the rarity of this condition and how little is known.

David Ebersman,"I co-founded a mental health company and now I’m stepping back for my mental health.

Ten years ago, I left a great job at Facebook to co-found Lyra Health. 

The inspiration for Lyra was born out of my personal experience seeking mental health care for a family member. We experienced the despair so common to this journey, including months-long wait times to see a therapist, ghost networks, and ineffective care. But we were persistent. Eventually we stumbled into the office of the right clinician, and the impact of quality care exceeded our highest expectations. Effective mental health care was life-changing. 

We founded Lyra to transform access to effective mental health care so that more people can find the support they need and the path to a better life. Over the last decade, Lyra has grown to cover 17 million people and has delivered more than 10 million sessions of evidence-based care around the world. 

While working at Lyra has been the honor of my career, I’ve made the difficult decision to step back from my role as CEO. Last year, my son, Sam, was killed after being struck by a vehicle while in a crosswalk. Our lives changed in an instant. 

I struggle to put into words what it feels like to lose a child. I have felt depths of sadness, anger, guilt, and hopelessness that are all-consuming and bear no resemblance to any emotions I have experienced previously. 

I hoped the passage of time and my return to work would help me recover. But thus far, I have mainly felt numb. This work is so important to me, but the energy it takes to be present for Lyra has left me with few reserves to support myself and my family. So I have decided that the best thing for me is to pull back from the company I love into a new role as Board Chairman.

We are so fortunate to have found a new CEO, Jennifer Schulz from Experian, who is an amazing leader and exemplifies Lyra’s values. She brings all the empathy, thoughtfulness and strategic vision needed to guide Lyra through our next chapter as we seek to help millions of people for generations to come.

To the Lyra team and everyone who has helped build this company, I can’t begin to adequately express my appreciation for the work you do every day to care for our clients. I am moved by your passion and skill. To the businesses and clients who have put your trust in us, I am so grateful to you and fully committed to meeting your needs today and into the future. To the clinicians at Lyra who dedicate their lives to helping people through tough times, I am awed by the positive impact you bring to the world.

It’s hard for me to talk about my struggles and my own mental health. But it’s the right thing to do. Mental health is one of the defining problems of our time and the dizzying pace of change throughout society only exacerbates the challenge. To anyone reading this who is suffering, please know that you are important, you are not alone, and you are allowed to ask for help.",12753,138,216,13107,Text Only
Anthropic,"Introducing Claude 3.7 Sonnet: our most intelligent model to date. It's a hybrid reasoning model, producing near-instant responses or extended, step-by-step thinking. One model, two ways to think.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a significant upgrade over its predecessor. In extended thinking mode, it self-reflects before answering, which improves its performance on math, physics, instruction-following, coding, and many other tasks.

We generally find that prompting for the model works similarly in both modes. API users also have fine-grained control over how long the model can think for.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a state-of-the-art model for coding and agentic tool use. However, in developing it, we optimized less for math and computer science competition problems, and more for real-world tasks. We believe this more closely reflects the needs of our customers.

We conducted extensive model testing for safety, security, and reliability. We also listened to your feedback. With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, we've reduced unnecessary refusals of requests by 45% compared to its predecessor.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code mark an important step towards AI systems that can truly augment human capabilities.

We look forward to seeing what you'll create. And we welcome your feedback as we continue to build. https://lnkd.in/egPBvEag",10496,1169,401,12066,Video
